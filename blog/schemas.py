# pydantic models are called schemas while

#This class directly inherits from Pydanticâ€™s BaseModel. It defines the basic schema for a blog with two fields: title and body. This is a plain Pydantic model used for data validation and serialization.

# This class inherits from your own Blog class, so it gets all the fields (title and body) from Blog. The only addition is the inner Config class with from_attributes=True, which allows Pydantic to create models from ORM objects (like SQLAlchemy models) using their attributes.
